00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Every human deserves dignity, safety, and a chance to thrive.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Together, we can build a world rooted in empathy and understanding.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Kindness is the language that connects all hearts.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
War destroys what humanity builds.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Peace is not weakness. Itâ€™s the strength to choose compassion.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In every war, itâ€™s the innocent who suffer the most.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
No child should grow up hearing bombs instead of bedtime stories.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Drop kindness, not bombs.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The true victory is a world without war.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Every weapon fired is a dream shattered.
